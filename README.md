Firechat

A chat app built completely on top of firebase, works in real time.

Want to talk and chat with coders and geeks, dont worry Firechat is just what you are seeking. Firechat will give you that coding environment where noobs reside.

Firechat is a test which I created for practise and testing chat functionality , It solemnly lies within incorporation of Swingle Inc.

Database : The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. While building cross-platform apps with all iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all the clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

Realtime: Instead of typical HTTP requests, the Firebase Realtime Database uses data synchronization—every time data changes, any connected device receives that update within milliseconds. Provide collaborative and immersive experiences without thinking about networking code.

Offline : Firebase apps remain responsive even when offline because the Firebase Realtime Database SDK persists your data to disk. Once connectivity is reestablished, the client device receives any changes it missed, synchronizing it with the current server state. Accessible from Client Devices : The Firebase Realtime Database can be accessed directly from a mobile device or web browser; there’s no need for an application server. Security and data validation are available through the Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules, expression-based rules that are executed when data is read or written.

Scale across multiple databases	With Firebase Realtime Database on the Blaze pricing plan, you can support your app's data needs at scale by splitting your data across multiple database instances in the same Firebase project. Streamline authentication with Firebase Authentication on your project and authenticate users across your database instances. Control access to the data in each database with custom Firebase Realtime Database Rules for each database instance.
